# Hub & Spoke

**Signature:** One central Home (Hub) acting as a dispatcher, leading to isolated functional mode screens (Spokes). Navigation always retreats to the center—spokes do not connect directly to one another.

## When to Use & Why

Use the Hub & Spoke pattern for multifaceted applications where tasks are highly distinct and require focused attention (e.g., a creative suite launcher, a bank app with discrete functions like "Transfer", "Pay Bills", "Statements", or a smart home controller).
**Why:** It reduces cognitive load by strictly isolating workflows. Users don't have to keep track of where they are in a complex hierarchy; they are either "doing a specific task" or "at home".

## UX Rules

### Do

- **Isolate State:** Entering a spoke resets its internal state (or restores it explicitly from a URL/database). Never casually inherit transient state from another spoke.
- **Prominent Return:** Every spoke MUST have an unambiguous, prominent "Back to Hub" or "Home" affordance, typically in the top-left corner.
- **Deliberate Transitions:** Use visual transitions (like a scale-up or slide-over) when entering a spoke to convey entering a dedicated environment.

### Don't

- **Cross-linking:** Never link Spoke A directly to Spoke B. If a user needs to switch tasks, they must return to the Hub first.
- **Persistent Sidebars:** Do not carry a global application sidebar into a spoke. The spoke is a focused mode and should own the entire viewport.

## Implementation Guide (Code & UX POV)

The Hub is usually a grid of large cards or icons. The Spokes are full-page layouts that hijack the routing completely.

### Recommended shadcn-svelte Components

- `Card` (for the Hub entry points)
- `Button` (for the "Back to Hub" action in Spokes)

### Component Recipe: `HubLayout.svelte`

```svelte
<!-- Example of a single layout file handling both states via routing logic -->
<script lang="ts">
	import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';
	import { ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-svelte';

	let {
		children,
		isHome = false,
		title = 'Application Hub'
	} = $props<{
		children: any;
		isHome?: boolean;
		title?: string;
	}>();
</script>

<div class="min-h-screen bg-background">
	{#if isHome}
		<!-- Hub View -->
		<main class="container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-12">
			<div class="mb-10">
				<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-foreground">{title}</h1>
				<p class="mt-2 text-lg text-muted-foreground">Select a workspace to begin.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- Children here would be a grid of Cards routing to spokes -->
			<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
				{@render children()}
			</div>
		</main>
	{:else}
		<!-- Spoke View -->
		<div class="flex h-screen flex-col overflow-hidden">
			<!-- Dedicated Spoke Header -->
			<header
				class="sticky top-0 z-10 flex h-16 shrink-0 items-center border-b border-border bg-background px-6"
			>
				<Button
					variant="ghost"
					size="sm"
					href="/"
					class="-ml-2 gap-2 text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground"
				>
					<ArrowLeft class="size-4" />
					Back to Hub
				</Button>
				<div class="mx-4 h-5 w-px bg-border"></div>
				<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">{title}</h2>
			</header>

			<!-- Spoke Content (Isolated) -->
			<main
				class="animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 flex-1 overflow-y-auto bg-muted/10 p-6 duration-300 md:p-10"
			>
				<div
					class="container mx-auto min-h-full max-w-6xl rounded-xl border border-border bg-background p-6 shadow-sm"
				>
					{@render children()}
				</div>
			</main>
		</div>
	{/if}
</div>
```
